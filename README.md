CS461 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Program 1

This program written in C++ simulates a group of 6 people playing poker and the odds they would have to win with each hand that they are given.
It compares 5 constantly changing hands against one static hand, and the results are then displayed into a separate text file for readability and into a separate CSV file that contains all of the raw data of the hands.
